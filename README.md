# 🕹️ 2D Multiplayer Game in Unity

This is a 2D multiplayer game built in Unity using **Netcode for GameObjects** and **Unity Gaming Services**. It features a host-client architecture where one player acts as the host (server + player), and others can join via lobby or join codes.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔗 **Host-Client Architecture**: One player hosts the game while others join as clients
- 🧠 **Game Objective**: Players collect coins to unlock the ability to shoot and heal themselves
- 🎮 **Real-Time Multiplayer**: Movement and interactions are synced across all players
- 🔄 **Network Synchronization**: Player movement, shooting, health, and pickups synced via Netcode
- 🧩 Built with **Unity 6000.1.7f1** and **Netcode for GameObjects**
